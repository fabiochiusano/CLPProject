# CLPProject

Complete compiler for the Tool language developed during the Computer Language Processing course at EPFL in first semester 2015. The language support basic types (Int, Boolean, String, Int Array and Objects), function, classes with single java-like inheritance and, as a final extention, a little library for graphics and user interactivity (like opening a window, drawing on it, reading the keyboard and so on).
